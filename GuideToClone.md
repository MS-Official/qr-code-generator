To clone your QR code generator repository from GitHub, follow these steps:

### 1. **Copy the Repository URL**

- Go to your GitHub repository page.
- Click the **"Code"** button, which is typically located at the top-right of the repository page.
- Under **Clone**, click on **HTTPS** and copy the URL. It will look something like this:

  ```
  https://github.com/MS-Official/qr-code-generator.git
  ```

### 2. **Clone the Repository**

Open a terminal on your computer and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MS-Official/qr-code-generator.git
```

This will create a local copy of the repository in a folder named `qr-code-generator`.

### 3. **Navigate to the Repository Folder**

Once the cloning process is complete, change your working directory to the newly created folder:

```bash
cd qr-code-generator
```

### 4. **Verify the Clone**

You can verify that the repository has been cloned successfully by running:

```bash
git status
```

This will show you the current status of your local Git repository.

### 5. **Install Dependencies (if necessary)**

If you haven't done so already, install any dependencies (such as `qrcode[pil]`) required to run the project. For example:

```bash
pip install qrcode[pil]
```

This will ensure that the necessary libraries for the QR code generation are installed.

Now you're ready to start working with the project locally! Let me know if you need further help!
